### üçâSUMMARY
In this project, I want to identify which factors of a car have a decisive role in its value. To obtain the sample data, I used a web scrapping library from Python to extract listed cars from autoscout24.com and then applied a multivariate regression model, which is a powerful tool to quantify the relationships between the car specifications and the car's prices. The results show that the distance the car traveled,  number of previous owners, car age, horsepower, and car transmission have significant impacts on second-hand car prices.
